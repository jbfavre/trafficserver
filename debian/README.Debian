trafficserver for Debian
------------------------

* (Apache) Traffic Server was a commercial product before. Hence expect some
  non standard behaviour for configuration files, command line handling and
  places to put files. 

  Feel free to file bug reports against LSB related issues although I will try
  to keep the impact as small as possible. 

* Traffic Server used to ship a Web User Interface (web UI) previously which is
  (for now) not functional anymore. Hence it is not available as Debian package

* Traffic Server is ongoing a major code refactoring process since the Apache
  Software Foundation took over development. Please note that this implies that
  some components of Traffic Server may behave differently than indicated in
  documentation and some configuration options may not be honored.

  There may be some legacy code paths that are not supposed to be working any-
  more. If you find something not working or some weird errors consider filing
  a bug report. Major features are working though. 

  I tried to point out some issues you will likely run into when modifying
  the default/trafficserver or init.d/trafficserver scripts. Also consider 
  reading CONFIGURATION.Debian.

* Similarly it lacks a comprehensive documentation about the binaries shipped
  along this package. That is, there are currently no man pages for most of 
  the programs distributed available. 
  
* If you read upstream's documentation about Traffic Server you will sometimes
  find references to a program `/usr/bin/trafficserver`. Debian does not ship
  this script. This is intentional. Use Debian's /etc/init.d/trafficserver
  script instead.
