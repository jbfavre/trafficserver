trafficserver for Debian
------------------------

Here are some configuration hints related to Traffic Server. Unless you already
noted, configuration files are located in /etc/trafficserver. Traffic Server
has some uncommon behaviour here: Please note, those files are generated auto-
matically and some may not even be intended to be edited manually. Moreover it
will rotate and synchronize configuration files if you run a cluster. Hence be
careful when editing them, chances are Traffic Server WILL OVERWRITE them. This
is especially true for comments which are not kept when using `traffic_line'
(as explained below).

  SECURITY WARNING
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Apache Traffic Server will open three listening sockets on your machine. Chan-
  ces are you may want to have at the listening process of `traffic_server' pu-
  blic facing.
  See below for instructions on how to restrict this interface to an IP address
  and port. By default `traffic_server' will listen on 0.0.0.0:8080 and
  0.0.0.0:8084. The latter is used for communication with `traffic_manager'.

  However, running `traffic_manager' will open more ports on your host.
  Those are (with 8088 only applying if you enable cluster mode - see below)
    + 0.0.0.0:8083 - the proxy autoconfiguration port to serve PAC files
    + 0.0.0.0:8088 - A CLI like remote configuration interface

  While you are able to change the listening port for those connections, it is
  currently not possible to restrict the listening interface as well. This im-
  plies Apache Traffic Manager may be remotely controlled if you enable cluster
  mode. THIS CHANGES AS SOON AS YOU ENABLE CLUSTER SUPPORT. THAT IS IF YOU CHAN-
  GE THE VALUE OF

    LOCAL proxy.local.cluster.type INT 3

  TO ANYTHING DIFFERENT FROM 3 (NOT CLUSTERING) TRAFFIC MANAGER MAY BE CONTROL-
  LED REMOTELY AS WELL. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A FIREWALL, FILTERING UNAUTHORIZED
  ACCESS. THERE IS CURRENTLY NO AUTHENTICATION TAKING PLACE HERE!

  If you do not need any of `traffic_manager''s features you may want to dis-
  able it completely (in that case you have to disable `traffic_cop' as well).
  See [5] for functionality added by `traffic_manager'.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* To get a general idea about traffic server and its architecture, read [4]. It
  is crucial to understand the internal architecture before trying to start.

* The main configuration file is `records.config'. You may either edit the main
  configuration file by hand, but it is suggested to use the `traffic_line'
  command instead. More on editing configuration files can be found on [1]. The
  `traffic_line' command is used like this:

	traffic_line -s proxy.config.proxy_name -v www.example.com

  You might need to tell Traffic Server about your changes. If it is already
  running use `traffic_line -x' to inform it about your changes. Please note
  that you must restart your `traffic_server' daemon for some changes.

* If you used Squid before you might find [2] helpful which lists Traffic Serv-
  er configuration directives along their Squid equivalent. Use this as resour-
  ce to understand Traffic Server.

* To help you to get started, I am going to introduce you very briefly to Traf-
  fic Server. Note, lines starting with `#' are remarks:

    Open `records.config'.

    # Configure the cluster interface
    CONFIG proxy.config.cluster.ethernet_interface STRING eth0


    # You may also want to bind your proxy server to a specific IP:
    # Please note the security warning below as well
    CONFIG proxy.local.incoming_ip_to_bind 1.2.3.4

    # Next configure the listening port for incoming connections
    CONFIG proxy.config.http.server_port INT 80

    # Now tell Traffic Server how much Memory it is allowed to consume
    # Set this value to -1 for best results which will instruct Traffic Server
    # to consume roughly 1 MB for each GB of your disk backend storage size
    # for memory caching. If you can afford it, go on and trash as much as
    # you want and put here any positive value indicating the memory cache
    # in bytes.
    CONFIG proxy.config.cache.ram_cache.size LLONG 131072 # (128 MB)

    Next edit `storage.config'. Debian ships with a default configuration poin-
    ting to a cache file in `/var/cache/trafficserver' sized 256MB. This is fair-
    ly ok for testing, otherwise feel free to change (value is in KB):

    /var/cache/trafficserver 262144

    Finally open `remap.config' where you need to tell Traffic Server about
    your origin server(s):

    map http://www.example.com/ http://www.example.com:8080/
    #   ----------------------  ----------------------------
    #   ^-  This is your client      This is your origin  -^
    #       Host: header that                    server.
    #       is to be mappend

* For a more comprehensive documentation about Traffic Server and its configu-
  ration directives consult [3].

  Yet the documentation on the web page can not be considered up to date for some
  parts. Feel free to ask for help on the Apache Traffic Server mailing list:

  E-Mail <users@trafficserver.apache.org>
  URL: <http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/trafficserver-users/>

  More information may be found on either resource among those:
  Project Website: <http://trafficserver.apache.org/>
  IRC: #traffic-server on irc.freenode.net.
  Project Wiki: https://cwiki.apache.org/TS/traffic-server.html

* Traffic Server can basically act in two modes: As forward proxy and as a rever-
  se proxy. Traffic Servers primary purpose is to act as reverse proxy (e.g.
  different to Squid). Nonetheless you can Traffic Server still instruct to act
  as forward proxy as well. If you know what you are doing, you need to set

     CONFIG proxy.config.url_remap.remap_required INT 0

  for that purpose.
