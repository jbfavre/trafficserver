trafficserver (2.1.8-unstable-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Debian specific changes:
    + Remove override for dh_clean, put options to debian/source/options
    + Base package on the untouched upstream tarball, instead of the
      versioned SVN branch
    + Remove DH_OPTIONS (unused anyway)
    + Some minor changes improving usability (i.e. grammar, verbosity of 
      comments)
