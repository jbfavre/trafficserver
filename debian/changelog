trafficserver (3.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Major changes (since 2.1.9):
    + `traffic_server' won't crash anymore when using non-existent plugin in
      remap rule
    + Don't cache HTTP 401, 303 and 407 error responses anymore, when negative
      caching is enabled.
  * Re-enable kfreebsd support, it was accidentally not available in
    2.1.9-unstable-1 because of non installable dependencies, as libcap-dev is
    installable (and required) on Linux only
  * debian/rules:
    + Simplify dh_auto_configure flags (upstream incorporated our build layout)
    + Enable WCCP (Web Cache Communication Protocol; Linux only)
  * debian/control:
    + Add flex and bison to build dependencies, both are required for WCCP
      (Linux only)

trafficserver (2.1.9-unstable-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Major features (since 2.1.8):
    + Bring back support for $DESTDIR and "make check" which makes Debian
      patches obsolete
    + Allow larger working sets than 512G
    + Disable cluster autodiscovery when cluster mode is disabled
    + Cleanup `records.config'
    + Disable SSLv2 by default
  * debian/control: Add build dependency to libcap-dev, because when running
    traffic_server standalone, it is unable to bind restricted ports otherwise
    (Upstream: TS-804)
  * debian/rules:
    + Remove override for dh_clean, but put options to debian/source/options
      instead
    + Remove DH_OPTIONS (unused anyway)
  * Source package: Minor change to improving package quality and usability
    (i.e. grammar, verbosity of comments)
  * Make the init script more robust
  * Base the origin of the package source on the untouched upstream tarball,
    instead of the versioned SVN branch.
  * Bring back IA64 support, this time actually working (upstream merged my
    patch TS-783)
  * Remove patch `build-quirks.patch'. Changes have been committed upstream
    by now.

  * Fix "FTBFS on architectures not supported upstream": (Closes: #622800)
    + Don't execute regression checks for now (fixes x86)
    + Upstream merges a Debian patch originally for 2.1.7 which enables
      kFreeBSD support (originally provided by myself)
    + Restrict Architectures (drop S390, IA64, MIPS[EL], PPC, SPARC)
  * Remove ts-ui-disable-conf.patch (applied upstream)
  * Update `build-quirks.patch' to make TS handle $DESTDIR correctly
    (upstream: TS-759)
  * Remove .deps from SDK binary package examples (they were incidentally
    included before).

  * Bump standards to 3.9.2, depend on debhelper 8.0, adapt VCS links
  * Simplify debian/rules
