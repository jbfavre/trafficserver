What this plugin does
=====================

in spite of its name, it compresses responses to the raw deflate format.
it also normalizes the accept-encoding header from user agent requests 
to either deflate or nothing. it compresses responses from origins only,
though it can be modified easily to also compress contents from cache.

Major issues
============
- there is an issue with *some* origins that send connection:close. 
  the plugin will not execute in that situation as a temporary fix.
- the workings of this plugin support our use case, but probably is not 
  on size fits all. it shouldnt be too hard to adjust it to your own needs though.
